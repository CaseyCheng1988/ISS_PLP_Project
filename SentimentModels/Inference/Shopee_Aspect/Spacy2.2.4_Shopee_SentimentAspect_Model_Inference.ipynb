It still closed completely but the plastic made to look like leather was literally falling off, so it was time for a new one. Cigarette cases for kings size cigs are not easy to come by these days I discovered, but I was thrilled to find this one on Amazon. It was a great price, REAL LEATHER, and even had the cool zipper pouch on the back. I was so excited to get my case and toss that other one! Well, within THREE DAYS one of the gold clasps literally broke off! I couldn't believe it! I tried to super glue it back on and was not successful. so, I still use the case but it doesn't close securely. I was very disappointed that my $3.00 plastic one lasted 7 years and this real nice leather one lasted 3 days!! But I still love the zipper pouch on the back, it's great for the spare key to my car because I will not go ANYWHERE without my cigarettes!\n",

There is even a small zippered pocket for change or whatever else. I was very pleased with it.

The three pair are serving well alongside their far more expensive drawer-mates. It's hard to imagine someone getting excited by a pair of socks, but these are worth getting excited about.

I have to tape over my belt buckles or any metal that contacts my skin and was diagnosed as severely allergic by my doc after allergy skin test. About a year ago I got my ears repierced with my daughter so we could have fun wearing jewelry and have tried every kind of hypo allergenic earring I could find: Studex, Sterling Silver 925, Surgical Steel, 14k gold, and had allergic reactions to all of them if worn for even an hour. Studex that my ears were pierced with was the worst! Bleeding, red itchy swollen earlobes a few weeks to heal in between each time I wore earrings! Searched Amazon for an hour to find these and did some research. They work as promised! I had to force them through (holes had partially closed) and had some initial healing for about 2 weeks. Now I'm wearing them 24/7 no problems! It's a first and really wonderful. I will get more. This size is a bit small for a main earring so I will get the next size up. THANK YOU.\n",

Many of my runs have taken place in temperatures within the 20s, and while the gloves are not winter gloves, they are working out. My hands are cold as I start my run and the tips of my fingers do sting initially, but after about half a mile or a mile, I've warmed up enough that my hands become comfortable. In fact, I think if I were wearing anything heavier, the warmth of the gloves might become too much. These allow me to go for 8-mile runs without feeling like I have to take them off.

That being said, I'd purchase these again if I had to do it all over again. At this price point, you can't beat them.\n",

      "Review text: Over quite a few years I've bought and worn Silver Forest jewelry, especially earrings, and used to get so many compliments on them.  Unfortunately, their aesthetic has changed over time, away from what made their pieces special and interesting.  Many of their designs used to be kind of contemporary and unusual, with the multiple, individually moving components, contrasting materials and textures, and subtle color palettes creating a unique feel.  They were sort of sophisticated but relatively affordable.  Some designs veered more towards conventionally pretty or delicate, while some were more like abstract modern art pieces, but all were pretty well made and special.  These days, it seems they go more towards an overly \"pretty\" aesthetic, too overwhelmingly using motifs such as lace, flowers, tear-drop shapes, and such, all made with less interesting materials.  Such things are not bad, necessarily, but the variety is gone, and their pieces are just not very special anymore.  I'm very disappointed and will probably not seek out their products as I have over the years.  Too bad.\n",

      "Review text: These are the most comfortable things I have ever worn on my feet; I bought them for gymnastics and I'm so happy that I did; They are so comfortable! But just in case you didn't know: the straps are only attached at the back of the slipper; So you have to sew them into the front- I'm assuming for proper fit; This is a bit annoying- coupled with the fact that there is no loop or area of fabric to sew them into without having to see your handy work through the front(no good if your terrible at sewing like me); And they soil easily;This should be expected of course(especially if they are white). Still, as my title suggests,they earn 5 stars and more because they truly are that comfortable; Especially when walking on carpet; I can't well explain why, because the shoes really have no padding; But they hug your feet and support your arch to an extent (I'm assuming these would not be as comfortable for flat footed people).The price is great and, if you are into ballet, what do you have to loose.\n",

There are lots of imitations out there, but only Birkenstock products hold up the way you need them to.  A bit more to pay for the guarantee of durability and craftsmanship that will make these sandals last SOOOO much longer than the \"knock-offs\", but well worth the comfort and peace of mind.\n",

First, the toe plate... it's not so much curved as it is a slight \"V\" shape.  It is possible to stand on your toes, simply by leaning forward and shifting your weight a little.  When you lean back again, the heel comes back down to the ground and your toes roll up a little.  This may be difficult to imagine, and again, it may just be because I have not worn heels before.

I had hoped they would fit like the \"croft & barrow\" shirts I bought somewhere in the US, but if I've learned anything from my forays into the US, it's that hope is not a strategy.\n",

It is a trite complaint but it did seem odd that all 3 shirts had the imprinted name and information (instead of the bothersome tag) and the printing was off center and slanted downhill??? The only problem with that would be if it showed through his dress shirts, but I doubt that will happen.  Really impressed with the softness and the extra length.\n",

His favorite part about these shirts is that you can barely feel the material in comparison to all of his cotton shirts.  So, they're definitely light/thin material.  He would never wear them as a regular shirt unless it's in a casual setting (e.g. to bed).\n",

He's all around a huge guy (height, weight, and his shoulders) and while he normally wears XLs, sometimes they fit too tight on him due to his shoulders and neck.  This XL fit perfectly with a little room to spare, so if you're a bigger person with regards to your height and shoulders, get your normal size, otherwise definitely size down.\n",

      "Review text: I love CK t-shirts. They are very soft and comfortable. It is hard to determine if the size is \"true.\" With vanity sizing these days, every brand seems to be different. I typically wear an XL in most brands (6'0\" tall and 215 lbs - 44R suit size). I usually get XL to compensate for my beer belly, but these were quit large and baggy for me personally with my dimensions. I then ordered size Large because they were such a great price and find that they fit much better. Still roomy enough not to grip my belly too much and fit my frame much better. The V-Neck helps draw attention away from that awful looking beer gut. Further, the length is great as I am fairly tall in the torso and have a problem with most brands because they are not long enough. They did not shrink on the initial two washes/dries, but in my past experience with CK t-shirts, after repeated washing/drying they do tend to shrink a bit and lose their softness (around 1 year of use) - which is probably typical of most all brands and the repeated abuse of machine washing and high heat drying.\n",

Very good construction and stitching, which is appreciated as some off brands (with lower prices) can't stand the test of time or multiple washes. In the end quality is less expensive, as you don't have to replace shirts as often, due to separated seams or fraying at the V point in the shirt.\n",

      "I'm about to place my 3rd order of these shirts. I ordered 9 over one year ago, and 9 one year prior to that. I am one of those guys who just sweats a lot. To ensure the shirts the world sees stay alive for longer, i wear these guys underneath. If I were to rate these shirts lower for any reason, it would be that the collars at the side of my neck wrinkles, But that's specific to me and my body, because my neck is larger than the body size the shirt is built for. At the V of the neck, the shirt maintains it's structure, rests comfortably and it's so thick that I notice it, even when it's under a shirt, a tie and a v-neck sweater. I had a thought of buying another shirt to see if these could be beat, but I can't see the reason to risk it. I realized today that I may be over the clock on buying these and I was. I told myself to replace them every 6 months and it's been a year. Did these shirts lose their color? After a year of my use, and zero bleach, yes. But I don't think there is a single white shirt on the planet that can endure a year with me, my sweat, my abuse and my cleaning techniques. The color fading is the only reason I remembered I needed to replace them.\n",

Over that time I have probably purchased 6 or 7 packages, some through Amazon and some through other retailers. The first few I had no problem with, but after that, the length varied drastically with each new package I got. The variance between shortest and longest runs about 4 inches. Within a package, they are consistent, but not when comparing those from different packages. This is a problem when using under dress shirts, as the short ones can come untucked very easily and bunch above your pant waistband, or if wearing solo, you get to show off your stomach whenever you raise your hands above eye level. If you get a package and after a wash they seem shorter than they should be, exchange for a different package to try again.\n",

They're wrinkly from being packaged, but you can easily remedy that by letting them sit out for awhile before use. They breathe very well, and are sheer like pantyhose, so you shouldn't have a problem with wearing footwear. Also, they were cheaper here, and they came pretty fast! I would recommend this product and seller! :)\n",

I have size 10 feet and was worried these wouldn't fit, but they do ~ The only thing I don't like is that the lace isn't the neatest, like they sew the lace  around the top of the sock and instead of sewing the end and beginning of the lace together, they overlap the lace and then just cut. I put a little bit of clear nail polish over the cut of the lace to stop it from unraveling.\n",

Because, they do look costume-y. But for 5 dollars... they are a good deal. Especially if it is for a costume, or you just wanna add another pair to your collection. I would recommend these, just because of the low price. It can't hurt to buy them. They may not be my favorite pair but I will surely still use them occasionally.

      "Review text: I bought these for a Halloween costume and for that purpose, they worked just fine. The foot is made out tights-like material and slips on easily. The ruffle is pretty, but oddly doesn't actually make a full circle- it just kind of overlaps at a random point and the ends aren't even finished, so it's a little bit scraggly. I guess that the nylon-style foot led to some sweating, because the bottoms made the dye from the inside of my shoes absorb into the sock- I washed them, but now the bottoms are blue. The shoes were cheap costume shoes, so I can't really blame that on the sock, but if you want the bottoms to stay white, beware colorful shoes. I thought I might wear them with ankle boots in a non-costume outfit, but they kept sort of slinking into my boot and with the scraggly edges, I wasn't crazy about looking like my feet were unraveling all day. I give them three stars, but I would just buy them if you have a one-night costume need and then toss them.\n",

I love having the different types of amber (very pretty). Since it is a bigger ring, I would suggest you get this for an index or middle finger (unless you won't be wearing another ring on the same hand). I'd also not wear it right next to another ring as the silver band could get scratched. Size is pretty true, but the band is mildly adjustable - I was able to open the band a bit with some well-applied pressure (not easy, but possible).

      "Review text: Every once in a while, you find finely crafted silver-work at a ridiculously low price and Gem Avenue is one of those rare finds.  I've bought several of their sterling silver chains, including 2 box links, and the quality exceeded all my expectations in each case.  The chains are sturdy, yet maintain their smooth flexibility over time. There is no \"play\" between the links and, though all are fine guage, even the thinnest has a heft that just feels \"expensive\" (kind of like the sound and solid feel of the closing of an expensive car door).  The clasps easily slide into their housing and the spring is taut yet easy to manage with no \"hanging\".\n",
      "\n",
      "  I personally own only 1 box link chain, one my kids bought me about 10 years ago in a little specialty shop. It was just the right size for me (about 1/16th\" thick link), heavy, and cost $150.00 at the time.  I know, I swallowed my tongue, too.  But it was a very special celebration and came from their hearts with a little help from Mom.  Definitely a stretch on our budget but they felt the chain was important (and I bring it up as a comparative price for fine Sterling 10 years ago). But afterward I learned that there were roving silver artists who sold their work for whatever was necessary to build their business.  We just had to trip over them if we found them at all in this city or that.  Certainly, today you can find cheaply priced silver chains any number of places but, likely as not, you end up with a cheaply constructed chain, possibly even an overlay or plating, links that kink or break, clasps that don't quite \"seat\" properly or fail altogether.  Gem Avenue is the smooth ride on tarmac after a juddering of a day driving over rock-strewn.  These craftsmen take obvious pleasure and pride in their silver-work and it does show.  And to beat it all, they're pricing this fine sterling as if it was costume jewelry.  Oh, and they thoughtfully toss in a nice little jewelry box for each chain purchased.  Why spend so much time reviewing a few silver chains?  Heaven knows if there were problems with the products we'd see postings in those CAPITAL LETTERS with which some express their fury that something was not to their liking.  When a company obviously cares about their products and seems to see each silver chain as a representative of their company, as this company appears to, the suits need to know that the people doing the actual creative work are doing a cut above and that brings back repeat and new customers via referral and \"through the grapevine.\n",

The chains are exactly what I was hoping to receive.  They are sturdy without looking cheap (and actuallly look very expensive).  They hang nicely and the clasp looks well made.  I have two silver pendants that I like to wear often so it was important to get a chain for each that would withstand daily wear.  Additionally, I have long hair which can sometimes be problematic when wearing chains.  My hair can get caught in a clump near the clasp or I can inadvertantly break the chain when brushing my hair.  I chose the \"box\" type chain and this type of clasp for these reasons as it's the strongest chain available while still looking dainty.  I'm very pleased with both the quality and the price.  I tried to get the same kind of chain at our local department store and it was twice as much.  You won't be disappointed!\n",
